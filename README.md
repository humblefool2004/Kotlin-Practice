# Kotlin Practice

This repository contains my Kotlin practice files as I learn the language for Android development.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `src/main/kotlin/` â†’ Kotlin basics practice (arrays, loops, functions, OOP, operators, etc.)
- Each file explores different Kotlin concepts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The goal of this repo is to track my progress in Kotlin programming, which will help me build a strong foundation for Android development.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- More Kotlin practice (collections, coroutines, advanced OOP)
- Start Android-specific projects with Kotlin
