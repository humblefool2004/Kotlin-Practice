# Kotlin Practice

This repository contains my Kotlin practice files as I learn the language for Android development.

## 📂 Structure
- `src/main/kotlin/` → Kotlin basics practice (arrays, loops, functions, OOP, operators, etc.)
- Each file explores different Kotlin concepts.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repo is to track my progress in Kotlin programming, which will help me build a strong foundation for Android development.

## 🏃 How to Run the Code
1. **Using IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)**:
    - Open IntelliJ IDEA → `File > Open` → Select this repository folder.
    - Navigate to the Kotlin file in `src/main/kotlin/`.
    - Right-click the file → `Run 'FileNameKt'`.

2. **Using Command Line** (if Kotlin is installed):
    - Compile:
      ```bash
      kotlinc src/main/kotlin/FileName.kt -include-runtime -d FileName.jar
      ```  
    - Run:
      ```bash
      java -jar FileName.jar
      ```

## 🚀 Next Steps
- More Kotlin practice (collections, coroutines, advanced OOP)
- Start Android-specific projects with Kotlin

💡 Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
